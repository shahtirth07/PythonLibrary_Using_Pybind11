# 🚀 **MATH608_PROJECT: Accelerating Data Cleaning with C++**

![Project Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=MATH608+Data+Cleaning+Accelerator)

---

## 📜 **Project Overview**
**MATH608_PROJECT** is a Python package designed to accelerate common data-cleaning operations by leveraging the power of C++. This project bridges the gap between Python's ease of use and C++'s performance to offer blazing-fast operations for cleaning and transforming data.

Key Features:
- **Core Operations**: Trim spaces, count nulls, convert text to lowercase, replace characters, and calculate cosine similarity.
- **High Performance**: Significant speed improvements compared to Pandas' equivalent operations.
- **Clean Design**: Modular architecture for easy integration into data workflows.
- **Interactive Benchmarks**: Compare the speed of C++ vs Pandas using real-world datasets.

💡 Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
setuptools and wheel for building the package
Installation Steps
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/MATH608_PROJECT.git
cd MATH608_PROJECT
Build and install the package:

bash
Copy code
cd src
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
python setup.py install
Verify the installation:

python
Copy code
from my_cleaning_package import trim_spaces_py
print(trim_spaces_py("   hello world   "))  # Outputs: "hello world"
📊 Benchmarks
Compare the performance of C++ implementations with Pandas/NumPy.

Sample Results:
Operation	Pandas Time (s)	C++ Time (s)	Speedup
Trim Spaces	0.002	0.0008	2.5x
Count Nulls	0.0015	0.0005	3x
Convert to Lowercase	0.003	0.001	3x
Replace Characters	0.0025	0.0007	3.6x
Cosine Similarity	0.045	0.018	2.5x
📈 Interactive Demo: Run the benchmarking script to test on your own datasets:

bash
Copy code
python benchmarks/benchmark.py
🧪 How It Works
C++ Integration
The package uses setuptools and pybind11 to integrate C++ functions into Python. Each operation is implemented in a modular manner for maintainability and extensibility.

Core Functions
Trim Spaces: Removes leading/trailing spaces.
Count Nulls: Counts None or 0 values in a list.
Lowercase: Converts strings to lowercase.
Replace Characters: Replaces characters in strings.
Cosine Similarity: Computes similarity between two vectors.
🖼️ Preview
Data Cleaning in Action
python
Copy code
from my_cleaning_package import trim_spaces_py, count_nulls_py, to_lowercase_py

data = ["   hello   ", " world", None]
print(trim_spaces_py(data[0]))  # "hello"
print(count_nulls_py(data))     # 1
print(to_lowercase_py("HeLLo")) # "hello"
Benchmarking Example
python
Copy code
from benchmarks import benchmark
from my_cleaning_package import cosine_similarity_py

vec_a = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] * 10000
vec_b = [4.0, 5.0, 6.0] * 10000

# Measure performance
benchmark(lambda: cosine_similarity_py(vec_a, vec_b), name="C++ Cosine Similarity")
